This is class project for Getting and Cleaning Data.

The data was initally downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

Once the files are unpackaged, use run_analysis.R to output text file of the average standard devations and means for each subject and activity. The R script will combine the data from the original download into a single tidy dataset.


It is important to note that each subject is not present in both the train and test data sets.
